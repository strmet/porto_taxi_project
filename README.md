# Facility location problem analysis (Porto Taxi stand location)

During this project we have devloped and compared different clustering algorithms, in order to solve the facility location problem.

An example of the clusters found with the k-means algorithm.

We have shown that using a sample of the data set can be really effective. CLARAFAST is clearly faster than the other methods and it still achieve the same cost in the objective function.
